# NetPractice

**NetPractice** is a 42 school project where I learned the basics of computer networking through interactive exercises.  
The goal of the project is to understand how TCP/IP addressing works and how to configure small-scale networks so that they become functional.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- The project comes with an interactive web interface (`index.html`) where I had to solve networking problems step by step.  
- There are **10 levels**, each with a broken network that needs to be fixed.  
- The main tasks involved:
  - Assigning correct IP addresses.  
  - Setting up subnet masks.  
  - Configuring routes so devices could communicate properly.  
- The interface provides logs and real-time feedback, which helped me debug my configurations.  
- Once solved, I exported the solutions using the **[Get my config]** button and submitted them (1 file per level).

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
- How IP addressing and subnetting work.  
- How to configure networks with hosts, routers, and subnets.  
- Hands-on practice in solving real networking problems.  
- Built a solid foundation for more advanced networking and system administration projects.

## âœ… Evaluation
- During the defense, I had to solve **3 random levels (from 6 to 10)** within 15 minutes.  
- No external tools were allowed (except for a simple calculator like `bc`).  

## ðŸš€ Takeaway
This project really helped me get more comfortable with networking fundamentals, especially subnetting and IP routing, which are essential skills for both system administration and more advanced network setups.
