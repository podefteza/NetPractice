# NetPractice
**NetPractice** is a 42 school project designed to introduce the basics of computer networking through interactive exercises. The goal is to learn how TCP/IP addressing works and how to configure small-scale networks to make them functional.

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
- The project provides an interactive web interface (index.html) where you solve networking problems step by step.
- You will encounter 10 levels, each presenting a broken network that must be fixed.
- The tasks involve assigning correct IP addresses, subnet masks, and routes so devices can communicate properly.
- Logs and real-time feedback help debug configurations.
- Solutions are exported with the [Get my config] button and submitted to the repository (1 file per level).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Objectives**
- Understand IP addressing and subnetting.
- Learn how to configure networks with hosts, routers, and subnets.
- Gain hands-on practice in solving networking problems.
- Build the foundation needed for more advanced networking and system administration projects.

## âœ… **Evaluation**
- During defense, you will be asked to solve 3 random levels within 15 minutes.
- No external tools are allowed, except for a simple calculator (e.g., bc).
- Be prepared for small modifications to ensure real understanding of networking concepts.
